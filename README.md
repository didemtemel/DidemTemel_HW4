Homework 4

Use the template we used during today's class. (https://colorlib.com/wp/template/onetech/)

Prepare product page and search page like the pages in template. You have these pages in your project, so you just need to redesign these pages with template layout.

Add menu items to layout with this template and remove unnecessary menu items from template layout.

This layout has category selection in search area, make it working too. So, when category is selected in that area, it will do the search according to text given and category selected together.

** Add your homework to your own GitHub page and share the link here. Name your repository as NameSurname_HW4 and do not forget to specify the repository as public. Otherwise, we cannot reach your project. Do not forget to add all your project folder content to GitHub.

** Be careful that the deadline is Monday, because we will see the solution during that class. Late homeworks will not be accepted.
